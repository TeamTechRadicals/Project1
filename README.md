# Apprenticeships Project

Apprenticeships flow is a web app that allows user to create an apprenticeship.

## Project Description

### What the Project does

Companies working with RadicalX want to be able to provide 3-6 months paid apprenticeships to the top talent coming out of the RadicalX internship program. RadicalX apprenticeships enable companies to discover, build and manage a cloud team to work on specific projects on-demand. The idea is that companies will be able to build and onboard an apprenticeship team in days and it will allow them pay-as-you-go flexibility. In order to do this, companies need to create an apprenticeship on the RadicalX platform.

### Technologies Used

For front-end development, chakra ui was used due to its precise and simple coding.  
`chakra-ui` (https://chakra-ui.com/)

For back-end development, firebase was used...
`fire-base` ()

### Challenges, Lessons, and Next steps

In the future, we hope to implement the login feature which would allow any user to log in.
